# Overview

To practice Java, I decided to go through some of the Advent of Code puzzles from 2023. Included in this repo are days 1, 2, and 3.

The puzzles require loading a large data set from a file, and manupulating it to generate some large number as an output.

Due to the simple, but varied, nature of the puzzles, this repository can serve as a resource for simple functions and example of Java use for my future reference.
